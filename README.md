## ðŸ‘‹ Hello world! Iâ€™m Pablo Hermun

I'm a Data Analyst and a multidisciplinary thinker with a background in **Physics**, and hands on experience on **programming, automation, and linux systems administration**.
Naturally curious and proactive, always seeking opportunities to optimize workflows through data and build understanding through visualization.

"Having the data is not enough, I have to show it ways people both enjoy and understand." - Hans Rosling
